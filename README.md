- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classification pipeline for a binary sentiment classification task. The model, feature extraction, the learning algorithm, the prediction algorithm and hyper parameter grid search were implemented from scratch to understand the inner workings of the full pipeline.
- **Multi-Class Classification**:  Built a dataset parser, feature encodiing, probabilisitic and non-probabilistic models and evaluation for two datasets (fetch20 and Reutures). Compared classifiers and features and analyzed the results.
- **RNN based POS Tagger**: POS tagging using LSTMs and mini-batch training, evaluating the model on several languages.
- **Gendered Directions in Embeddings**: Testing the hypothesis of https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520.

- Delivery Man: Using the **A* algorithm** to find optimal routes to work out what moves should be made in the game, given the traffic conditions.
- CIFAR **Image Classification**: Building and training a CNN to classify images (cifar10 dataset) according to their content.

## Advanced Programming
